# IMDB-Search-Engine
Indexes the IMDB provided file of movies and provides search functionality.
SearchEngine - uses a TreeMap to sort the movies
HashFunction - uses HashMapForStrings to sort

To run, use the command:

java -Xmx1g SearchEngine plotunsorted.list

or 

java -Xmx1g HashFunction.java plotunsorted.list

in terminal. This uses 1 gigabyte of memory instead of the normally allocated 128MB.


Done in colloboration with Holt Maki '18 for Dave Musicant's Data Structures class.
