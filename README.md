# IMDB-Search-Engine
Indexes the IMDB provided file of movies and provides search functionality.
SearchEngine - uses a TreeMap to sort the movies
HashFunction - uses HashMapForStrings to sort

To run, use the command:

java -Xmx1g SearchEngine plotunsortedsmall.list

or 

java -Xmx1g HashFunction plotunsortedsmall.list

in terminal. This uses 1 gigabyte of memory instead of the normally allocated 128MB. However, due to the limitations of github I can't upload the full database list that allows for full functionality of the hash map. If you would like it sent to you, let me know!


Done in colloboration with Holt Maki '18 for Dave Musicant's Data Structures class.
